# Writing Voice

## Style Characteristics

More like an article written for Wired Magazine rather than Infoworld
Technical level should be above Scientific American but slightly below a masters in EE/CS for technical writing.

## Tone
Intelligent, yet "snappy" I'm proud to have spent my formative years in New York City. And take pride in my snarky, slightly sarcastic tone.
