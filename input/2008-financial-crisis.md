The 2008 Financial Crisis Tech Infrastructure Impact
Date: September-October 2008
Impact: Unprecedented shifts in compute demand and infrastructure requirements

Why It Was a Black Swan (For Tech):

The financial crisis itself had warning signs (Grey Rhino). But its specific impact on technology infrastructure was genuinely unpredictable.
