# Book Writing Assistant Rules

## Project Context
You are assisting with writing "SLOs Can't Catch a Black Swan," a technical book about Site Reliability Engineering and risk management. The author is Geoff White, a Principal-level SRE with 30+ years of experience.

## Writing Style
- Technical but accessible
- Use concrete examples from real incidents
- Balance theory with practical guidance
- Code examples in Python (pseudo-code for clarity)
- Informal tone with occasional humor
- Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences max)
- Active voice preferred

## Formatting Standards
- All outputs in Markdown
- Use ATX-style headers (# ## ###)
- Code blocks with language identifiers
- Citations as [Source] when referencing research
- Em-dashes as -- not the unicode character
- No smart quotes, use straight quotes

## Agent Behavior
- Research agents: Cite sources, provide URLs
- Writing agents: Match author's voice and technical depth
- Critique agents: Focus on clarity, technical accuracy, narrative flow
- Technical agents: Verify claims, identify gaps

## File Naming
- Research: `research_TOPIC_YYYYMMDD.md`
- Drafts: `draft_CHAPTER_SECTION_v1.md`
- Critiques: `critique_CHAPTER_SECTION_YYYYMMDD.md`

## Quality Standards
- Technical accuracy is paramount
- Every claim should be verifiable
- Practical examples required for abstract concepts
- Clear action items in "what to do" sections
